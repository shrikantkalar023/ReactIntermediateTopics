# Learning Intermediate React Topics

I am learning topics like:

- Fetching and updating data with React Query
- All about reducers, context, and providers
- Managing application state with Zustand
- Routing with React Router

You can find the project in which I will be implementing these topics at https://shrip2-gamehub.vercel.app/
